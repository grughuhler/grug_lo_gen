Quisk is cool but is a bit of a beast, and I don't understand it well.

I started by using quisk's config GUI (the config buttom) to create a
"fixed" radio that I called "tayloe_fixed" and pointed the GUI at this
file.  You just have to fiddle with the quisk GUI until you figure it
out.

You must edit this file to select your serial port.

Also, it does not work right at startup.  You have to tune something
first, e.g. by entering a frequency in Hz into the tuning box in the
GUI.  Then, all is well.

You could also use gqrx instead of quisk, gqrx is usually excellent,
but when reading from a sound card, it does not appear to correctly
process IQ data.  Quisk does and so does gnuradio, so I did not
further investigate.

Strong local medium wave AM stations are the easiest to receive.
