Quisk is cool but is a bit of a beast, and I don't understand it well.

I started by using quisk's config GUI (the config buttom) to create a
"fixed" radio that I called "tayloe_fixed".

Then, I used the config GUI to associated the python file in this
directory with "tayloe_fixed".  You just have to fiddle with the quisk
GUI until you figure it out.  You also need to use the "Sound" subtab
under "*tayloe_fixed*" to set your sound card's sample rate. On the
same subtab you select the sound device.

For Linux, I set the sound device to "pulse" and then used PulseAudio
Volume Control to set the input device to "Built-in Audio Analog
Stereo".

Quisk also works on Windows.  There, I set Radio Sound Output to
"Primary" and I/Q Rx Sample Input to "Line In".

You must edit this python file to select your serial port.  If the
serial port is not found, quisk will crash.

Also, it does not work right at startup.  You have to tune something
first, e.g. by entering a frequency in Hz into the tuning box in the
GUI.  Then, all is well.

You could also use gqrx instead of quisk, gqrx is usually excellent,
but when reading from a sound card, it does not appear to correctly
process IQ data.  Quisk does and so does gnuradio, so I did not
further investigate.

Strong local medium wave AM stations are the easiest to receive.
